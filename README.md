# CSE163 FINAL PROJECT  DIET AND DISEASE

 --Before running the code, please **extracting the dataset** from following website
 
    https://edstem.org/us/courses/21007/lessons/30963/slides/178641

 --Regarding the libraries, we only use the **libary** taught in the lectures
 
    sklearn, matplotlib, panda, geopanda, and seaborn

## --First Module:

    Utilizing the dataset of dietary compostion to plot the food composition and preference
    of each country.

## --Second Module: 

    We cleanned the dataset and apply the machine learning to get the relationship between
    the region, food, and disease. Generating the accuracy score to evaluate the quality of model
  
## --Third Module:
    
    Focused on the specific task and adopt the statistical method to test the effectiveness of
    our graph
